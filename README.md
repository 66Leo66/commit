## 🔎 About Commit
Commit is the world's simplest Git client. Open it with a keyboard shortcut, write your commit, and you're done! Commit will automatically detect which repo you've been working on, and even push for you (if you ask it to).

## 🛠️ Development

To run Commit locally, you'll need a local installation of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). Once you have both, install the Tauri CLI with `cargo install tauri-cli`, and run `cargo tauri dev` to start the development service, which will auto-reload on any changes.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

The idea to build this app came from [TailwindUI's Commit template](https://tailwindui.com/templates/commit), along with the initial design for the widget and the logo.
